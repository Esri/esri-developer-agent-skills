# Build with ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity

ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity is a Unity plugin for using real-world maps and 3D ArcGIS content in interactive 3D and XR experiences. Use it to bring geospatial data into Unity scenes through Map Creator, SDK Components, or the C# API.

## ArcGIS account requirements

Developers must have one of the following ArcGIS accounts to create applications: ArcGIS Location Platform (free), or ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise with a Creator, Professional, or Professional Plus user type. The account's user type, role, and privileges provide access to different resources and operations.

## Authentication

DO NOT SKIP: Refer to the `follow-arcgis-authentication-patterns` skill for ArcGIS authentication requirements, including the appropriate type of authentication for different audiences, use cases, and types of application. If the skill is not available, search the project for any existing authentication patterns, and if none are found, query the documentation MCP for authentication best practices.

## Installation and setup

1. Before creating or upgrading a project, check the [system requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/system-requirements/) for the SDK release in use. Verify Unity, render pipeline, and target-platform support.
2. Use HDRP or URP; the built-in render pipeline is unsupported. Check the setup guide for compatible render-pipeline package versions.
3. Install from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/arcgis-maps-sdk-for-unity-258537) or [SDK downloads](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/downloads/). For tarballs, use Package Manager's **Add package from tarball**. For existing projects, follow the [setup guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/install-and-set-up/add-the-plugin-to-an-existing-project/).
4. Import **Sample Content** if useful. Configure the scene with Map Creator, SDK Components, or the C# API according to the task.
5. Configure ArcGIS access using the authentication guidance above; keep credentials out of source control.
6. For upgrades, follow the [upgrade guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/install-and-set-up/upgrade-to-a-new-plugin-version/) and recheck project compatibility.

## How to query documentation

Documentation can be queried using the MCP for Esri Developers server:
```
https://developers-mcp.arcgis.com/mcp
```
Use the `search_esri_developer_docs` tool to surface authoritative documentation pages with `unity-sdk` as the `focus_area` parameter in addition to a specified `search_term`. Use the `fetch_esri_developer_docs` tool with the `page_url` parameter set to return the full content of a documentation page in Markdown format. 

Clearly indicate any recommendations and assumptions that are not grounded in the official documentation. If MCP is unavailable, consult official documentation URLs below.

## Patterns and guidelines

- Use C# scripting with the SDK API as the default approach; Use the SDK API directly; do not assume SDK Components are required. Use Map Creator for no-code map setup or SDK Components for GameObject-based integration. Components can also be configured through C#.
- Choose a global or local scene for the geographic extent. Ensure map and layer spatial references are compatible; the first layer may determine the map spatial reference.
- Preserve the ArcGIS Map's HPRoot setup, which addresses floating-point precision limits.
- For missing data, inspect view-state logs, camera extent, layer source, authentication, supported formats, and spatial-reference compatibility.
- Use the matching API reference and existing SDK components or samples instead of recreating SDK behavior.
- Check target-device requirements; editor success does not validate a player build.

## Validation process

- [ ] Check Unity, render pipeline, target platform, and installed SDK against the system requirements.
- [ ] Confirm the package and required Components are available; run a relevant sample when useful.
- [ ] Verify authentication and access to required ArcGIS resources without exposing credentials.
- [ ] Run the scene; check camera position, layer loading, Unity Console, and view-state logs.
- [ ] If data is missing, check spatial references, supported formats, and global/local scene choice.
- [ ] Build and test for the target platform when available.
